# pydolons

A turn-based RPG in python / PyQT.

I don't own the images / sounds, they are added for demo purposes only.


Interesting parts are:
1) Events system - allows for complex abilities that react to specific events under specific conditions, e.g. Undead - if the unit is about to be killed, do X instead (y times, then disable this ability).
